### April, 2021

--------------
### Overview
This command line To-Do application enables users to add and keep track the status of their tasks by due date, category, priority, and completion status. The application stores all its tasks in "todos.csv". The CSV file is a plain text file, with its first line as the headers for each column. The task data is organized into columns separated by a comma.<br />

The system allows the user to do the following and updates the CSV file accordingly:
* Add a new task to the To-Do list. User can specify various optional description about the task such as status of completion, due date, priority (1 - 3, 1 being the highest), and category.
* Complete an existing task.
* Display current To-Do's to terminal. Options include all To-Do's, filter incomplete To-Do's, filter To-Do's within particular category, sort by date (ascending), and sort by priority (ascending).

### Design
In our program, MVC design pattern was implemented to segregate the views from the model and controllers. MVC design allows to create separate and reusable models that can easily be updated; for example, updating the controller data affecting other packages.

Singleton pattern was also applied in the ToDoList class to have single instance of To-Do List to all clients at a time. This ensures thereâ€™s only one List of ToDo objects at all times for the program. Builder pattern was applied in ToDo class to simplify the construction of a To-Do object with various fields.
